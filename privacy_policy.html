  <h2 id="section1">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Personal information you disclose to us</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>In Short:</em>
    We collect personal information that you provide to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Services, express an
    interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on
    the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Personal Information Provided by You.</strong>
    The personal information that we collect depends on the
    context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you
    use. The personal information we collect may include the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>names</li>
    <li>email addresses</li>
    <li>usernames</li>
    <li>passwords</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> We do not process sensitive information.
  </p>
  <p>
    All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of
    any changes to such personal information.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Information automatically collected</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>In Short:</em>
    Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device
    characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information
    does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage
    information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
    preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our
    Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and
    operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>The information we collect includes:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Log and Usage Data.</strong>
      Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and
      performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we
      record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address,
      device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as
      the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you
      take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports
      (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Device Data.</strong>
      We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet,
      or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include
      information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers,
      location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system,
      and system configuration information.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Location Data.</strong>
      We collect location data such as information about your device's location,
      which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings
      of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect
      geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing
      us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location
      setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the
      Services.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="section2">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p>
    <em>In Short:</em>

    with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with the law. We may also process your information
    for other purposes with your consent.

  <p>
    We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services,
    including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>

      information so you can create and log in to your account, as well as keep your account in working order.

      To request feedback. We may process your information when necessary to request feedback and to contact you
      about your use of our Services.
    </li>

      To deliver targeted advertising to you. We may process your information to develop and display personalized
      content and advertising tailored to your interests, location, and more.

      To save or protect an individual's vital interest. We may process your information when necessary to save or
      protect an individual's vital interest, such as to prevent harm.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="section3">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p>
    <em>In Short:</em>
    We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid
    legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to
    provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to
    fulfill our legitimate business interests.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on
    in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
    personal information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Consent.</strong>
      We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to
      use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more
      about <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong>
      We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably
      necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests
      and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the
      purposes described in order to:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users</li>
      <li>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
      <li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong>
      We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for
      compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory
      agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which
      we are involved.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Vital Interests.</strong>
      We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to
      protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential
      threats to the safety of any person.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your
    personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,
    implied consent). You can <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdraw your consent</a> at any time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without
    your consent, including, for example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
    </li>
    <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
    <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
    <li>
      If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an
      insurance claim
    </li>
    <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
    <li>
      If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be a victim of financial abuse
    </li>
    <li>
      If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the
      accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach
      of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
    </li>
    <li>
      If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to
      the production of records
    </li>
    <li>
      If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the
      collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
    </li>
    <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
    <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="section4">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p>
    <em>In Short:</em>
    We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the
    following third parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Business Transfers.</strong>
      We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
      negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
      business to another company.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="section5">5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h2>
  <p>
    <em>In Short:</em>
    We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third parties
    that we may link to or who advertise on our Services, but are not affiliated with, our Services.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain
    advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites,
    services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we
    will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or
    applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an
    endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data
    collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or
    privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or
    applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties
    and contact them directly to respond to your questions.
  </p>
  <h2 id="section6">6. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
  <p>
    <em>In Short:</em>
    We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
    information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is
    set out in our Cookie Notice.
  </p>
  <h2 id="section7">7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
  <p>
    <em>In Short:</em>
    We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
    privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
    privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
    other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us to keep your personal information for
    longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
    anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
    stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
    further processing until deletion is possible.
  </p>
  <h2 id="section8">8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
  <p>
    <em>In Short:</em>
    We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical
    security measures.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
    protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
    secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
    guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
    unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
    modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
    personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
    secure environment.
  </p>
  <h2 id="section9">9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

  <p>
    <em>In Short:</em> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada,
    you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review,
    change, or terminate your account at any time.
  </p>

  <p>
    In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws.
    These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to
    request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if
    applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
    processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact
    details provided in the section <a href="#section14">"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you
    also have the right to complain to your <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/612080">Member
      State data protection authority</a> or <a
      href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/">UK data
      protection authority</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the <a
      href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html">Federal Data Protection and Information
      Commissioner</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong id="withdrawconsent">Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process
    your personal
    information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to
    withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the
    contact details provided in the section <a href="#section14">"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a>
    below or updating your
    preferences.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
    applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
    lawful processing grounds other than consent.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>

  <p>
    If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you
    can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
    <li>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from
      our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot
      problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal
      requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If
    you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to
    remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. You may also

  </p>

  <p>
    If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at prateekdahiya2722005@gmail.com.
  </p>

  <h2 id="section10">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

  <p>
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
    feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
    browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
    implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
    other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
    tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
    version of this privacy notice.
  </p>
  <h2 id="section11">11. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

  <p>
    <em>In Short:</em> Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to
    your personal information.
  </p>

  <p>
    California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are
    California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories
    of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and
    addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar
    year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in
    writing to us using the contact information provided below.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have
